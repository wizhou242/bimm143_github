## What is in the PDB database?

The main repository of biomolecular structure info is the PDB < www.rcsb.org >.

Let's see what this database contains:

```{r}
stats <- read.csv("pdb_stats.csv", row.names = 1)
stats
```


> Q1: What percentage of structures in the PDB are solved by X-Ray and Electron Microscopy.

```{r}
#as.numeric(stats$X.ray)
```
We got to get rid of the commas. Can you find a function to get rid of the commas?

```{r}
x<-stats$X.ray
sum(as.numeric(gsub(",","",x)))
```

I am going to turn this into a function and then use  `apply()` to work on the entire table of data.

```{r}
sumcomma <- function(x) {
  sum(as.numeric(gsub(",","",x)))
}

sumcomma(stats$X.ray)
```

```{r}
n.total <- sumcomma(stats$Total)
n.total
```

```{r}
sumcomma(stats$EM)
```

```{r}
apply(stats, 2, sumcomma)
```

```{r}
apply(stats, 2, sumcomma) / sumcomma(stats$Total)
```

```{r}
as.numeric(c(10, "10,000"))
```

```{r}
(184362/219140)*100
```
About 84% solved by X-ray.

```{r}
(20191/219140)*100
```
About 9% solved by EM.



> Q2: What proportion of structures in the PDB are protein?

248,805,733 - 186,898
```{r}
186898/248805733 * 100
```


# Visualizing the HIV-1 protease structure

Mol* ("mol-star") viewer is now everywhere. The homepage is here:
https://molstar.org/viewer/

I want to insert my image from Mol* here.

![My first molecular image](1HSG.png)

This image highlights an important water molecule and ASP25 on both chains by changing them into spacefill

## Working with bio3d package

```{r}
library(bio3d)
```

```{r}
pdb <- read.pdb("1hsg")
pdb
```

```{r}
head(pdb$atom)
```

```{r}
pdbseq(pdb)[25]
```

## Predicting functional motions of a single structure

We can do a bioinformatics prediction of functional motions (i.e. flexibility/dynamics):

```{r}
pdb <- read.pdb("6s36")
pdb
```

```{r}
m <- nma(pdb)
plot(m)
```

```{r}
mktrj(m, file="adk_m7.pdb")
```
