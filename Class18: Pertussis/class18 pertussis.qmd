Pertussis (whooping cough) is a highly contagious lung infection that is most deadly for the very young (under 1 year of age)

Let's begin by having a look at Pertussis case numbers per year in the U.S.

The CDC tracks Pertsusis case numbers and makes the data abailable here:

> Q1. With the help of the R “addin” package datapasta assign the CDC pertussis case number data to a data frame called cdc and use `ggplot` to make a plot of cases numbers over time.

I want to make a plot of case number per year.

```{r}
library(ggplot2)

ggplot(cdc) +
  aes(Year, Cases) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_line() 
```

> Q2. Using the ggplot `geom_vline()` function add lines to your previous plot for the 1946 introduction of the wP vaccine and the 1996 switch to aP vaccine (see example in the hint below). What do you notice?

```{r}
base <- ggplot(cdc) +
  aes(Year, Cases) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_line() 
```

```{r}
base + geom_vline(xintercept = 1946, col="blue") +
  geom_vline(xintercept = 1996, col="magenta") +
  geom_vline(xintercept = 2019, col="gray")
```

> Q3. Describe what happened after the introduction of the aP vaccine? Do you have a possible explanation for the observed trend?

After the aP vaccines were developed, we saw more cases of whooping cough. This could be possibly due to the fact that acellular vaccines contain only a few antigens to limit side effects but will trigger a weaker immune response compared to the whole cell vaccine they were initially using.

The rise in cases actually occurs around 10 years after the introduction of the aP vaccines as there are no 10 year clinical trials for vaccines. But why is aP induced protection waning faster than wP?

## CMI-PB

A systems vaccionalogy project to figure out what is going on with aP vs wP immune responses.

The resource has an API (application programming interface) that returns JSON format data.

Basically "key":"value" pair format.

We will use the jsonlite package to read this data into R

```{r}
library(jsonlite)

subject <- read_json("https://www.cmi-pb.org/api/subject", simplifyVector = T)

head(subject)
```


> Q4. How many subjects are in the dataset?

```{r}
nrow(subject)
```
> Q4. How many aP and wP infancy vaccinated subjects are in the dataset?

```{r}
table(subject$infancy_vac)
```

> Q5. How many Male and Female subjects/patients are in the dataset?

```{r}
table(subject$biological_sex)
```

> Q6. What is the breakdown of race and biological sex (e.g. number of Asian females, White males etc…)?

```{r}
table(subject$race, subject$biological_sex)
```

Read other tables from the CMI-PB sequence

```{r}
specimen <- read_json("http://cmi-pb.org/api/specimen", simplifyVector = T)
ab_titer <- read_json("http://cmi-pb.org/api/v4/plasma_ab_titer", simplifyVector = T)
```
```{r}
head(specimen)
```

```{r}
head(ab_titer)
```

I need to link or merge (join) these tables to get all the meta data I need about subjects and specimens in one place. We will use the **dplyr** `join()` functions for this task.

```{r}
library(dplyr)

meta <- inner_join(subject, specimen)

head(meta)
```

Now we can take our new `meta` table and join it with our Ab table `ab_titer`:

```{r}
abdata <- inner_join(ab_titer, meta)
dim(abdata)
```
```{r}
head(abdata)
```

```{r}
dim(abdata)
```

What Ab are measured/recorded in the `ab_data` table:

```{r}
table(ab_titer$isotype)
```

```{r}
table(ab_titer$antigen)
```

We have our merged dataset with all the needed metadata and anitbody measurments called `abdata`

```{r}
head(abdata, 2)
```

## Examine IgG Ab titer levels

Now using our joined/merged/linked abdata dataset filter() for IgG isotype.

```{r}
igg <- abdata %>% filter(isotype == "IgG")
head(igg)
```

```{r}
base <- ggplot(igg) +
  aes(MFI_normalised, antigen) +
  geom_boxplot() 
base
```

```{r}
table(igg$visit)
```


```{r}
base + facet_wrap(vars(visit), nrow=2)
```

Let's dig in a little bit more

```{r}
ggplot(igg) +
  aes(MFI_normalised, antigen, col=infancy_vac ) +
  geom_boxplot(show.legend = FALSE) + 
  facet_wrap(vars(visit), nrow=2) +
  xlim(0,75) +
  theme_bw()
```

```{r}
abdata.21 <- abdata %>% filter(dataset == "2021_dataset")

abdata.21 %>% 
  filter(isotype == "IgG",  antigen == "PT") %>%
  ggplot() +
    aes(x=planned_day_relative_to_boost,
        y=MFI_normalised,
        col=infancy_vac,
        group=subject_id) +
    geom_point() +
    geom_line() +
    geom_vline(xintercept=0, linetype="dashed") +
    geom_vline(xintercept=14, linetype="dashed") +
  labs(title="2021 dataset IgG PT",
       subtitle = "Dashed lines indicate day 0 (pre-boost) and 14 (apparent peak levels)")
